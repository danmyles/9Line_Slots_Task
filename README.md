    - **instructions:** Participant instructions will all be located here
    - **archived:** Older code that is no longer being used. Delete when task in complete
    - *boot_exp.m* - A MATLAB function to run set_up scripts. Must be located in code directory.
    - *begin_experiment.m* - Run this script to begin the experiment. You may need to modify config files to setup experiment as desired
