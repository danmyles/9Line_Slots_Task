# 9 Line Slot Task
## Dependancies

Make sure you have the following software and MATLAB packages installed:

  1. [MATLAB_2019a](http://mathworks.com)
  2. [PsychToolbox-3](http://psychtoolbox.org/)
  3. I installed https://www.xquartz.org/ in order to use the PsychToolbox function DrawFormattedText2
  
## File Structure

  - **output: ** Data generated by the experiment will be outputted here
  - **resources: ** This is where I have kept a number of resources and scripts written by others that were useful in making this task
  - **code: ** All scripts and functions necessary to run the 9LST
    - **functions:** All functions used in this task
    - **config:** Any files necessary for task set up will be located here
    - **instructions:** Participant instructions will all be located here
    - **archived:** Older code that is no longer being used. Delete when task in complete
    - *boot_exp.m* - A MATLAB function to run set_up scripts. Must be located in code directory.
    - *begin_experiment.m* - Run this script to begin the experiment. You may need to modify config files to setup experiment as desired

## Flow

Diagram of how experiment operates will be displayed here

This experiment is broken down into a multitude of functions. The rough order of operations is something like (see comments within each function for more details):

  1. Experiment Script (contains over-all structure)
	  2. Call "boot_exp.m"
		  3. This runs a series of set up functions:
			  - Start clock ("tic")
			  - Set file path
			  - Set up Psychtoolbox screen –> save to "screenInfo"
			  - Set up the slot machine grid –> save to "screenInfo"
			  - Set up reelInfo, creates:
				  - Shape, size and colour information for reel symbols
				  - Possible payout amounts, and display parameters
				  - Position information for the reel positions
				  - The sequence of symbols across the "reel strips"
			  - Set up a table for experiment output (trial by trial)
			  - Set max priority (limit processing power consumed by background activities)
	  1.  The loading screen function is called throughout to display a little graphic as the experiment progresses through these early set up procedures. Generating the reel strips can take a moment.
	  2.  [Instructions]
	  2.  We can then call the update stops function to generate a starting reel position, and the draw shapes and draw grid function to fill in the screen.
	  3.  

## Config

Explanation of how config file works will go here.

May end up having to change "reelInfo" to config? Or have reelInfo read 
from a config file that the user can pre-set...

## Functions

Explanation of the purpose of each function will go here

## How is the sequence of reel symbols allocated

I felt that the most balanced way to assign the sequence of symbols along the reel would be to include every possible sequence of 3 symbols (for each vertical position). I was familiar with the concept of de Bruijn sequences, in which a set (or "alphabet") of outcomes is ordered into a long cyclic (in that it is repeating) sequence which includes every permutation of some subsequence length (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_sequence). 

I wanted something similar, with the exception that repeats [1, 1, 1] OR [2, 5, 2] would not occur. This was because I did not want cases in which two wins on the same symbol could occur simultaneously. I came across some code to produce a "Katz sequence" which prevents consecutive repeats: 

Brimijoin, W. O., & O'Neill, W. E. (2010). Patterned tone sequences reveal non-linear interactions in auditory spectrotemporal receptive fields in the inferior colliculus. Hearing Research, 267(1-2), 96-110. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heares.2010.04.005

However, this did not prevent cases in which a repeat occurred within the subsequence non-simultaneously. So it took a bit of editing. Because of the way I came at this problem it had the code to generate deBruij or Katz style reels so I have left that in as an option, see "generate_reelstrip.m".
