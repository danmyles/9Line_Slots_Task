# Stimuli  
It seemed to me that a neat place to start learning to code in Psych toolbox and MATLAB would be to start by drawing the stimuli that I will eventually use in the final task. In short this folder currently contains scripts to do each of the following:  
  1. Draw a fixation cross.  
  2. Draw the stimuli
     - Circle  
     - Triangle  
     - Square  
     - Diamond  
     - Pentagon  
  3. Draw each of these on screen in the appropriate position.
