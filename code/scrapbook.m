% I need to produce three spreadsheets.

% One to record events that occur during the experiment
% This empty table will be the same at the begining of the experiments across
% participants. As the participant makes choices we fill in the outputData data table.

% Then we need two tables that contain the outcomes that are to occur
% during the experiment.
