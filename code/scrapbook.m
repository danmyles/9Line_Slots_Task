% Get the screen numbers. This gives us a number for each of the screens
% attached to our computer.
screens = Screen('Screens');

% To draw we select the maximum of these numbers. So in a situation where we
% have two screens attached to our monitor we will draw to the external
% screen.
screenNumber = max(screens);

% Define black and white (white will be 1 and black 0). This is because
% in general luminace values are defined between 0 and 1 with 255 steps in
% between. All values in Psychtoolbox are defined between 0 and 1
white = WhiteIndex(screenNumber);
black = BlackIndex(screenNumber);

% Do a simply calculation to calculate the luminance value for grey. This

% Length of time and number of frames we will use for each drawing test
numSecs = 1;
numFrames = round(numSecs / ifi);

% Numer of frames to wait when specifying good timing. Note: the use of
% wait frames is to show a generalisable coding. For example, by using
% waitframes = 2 one would flip on every other frame. See the PTB
% documentation for details. In what follows we flip every frame.
waitframes = 2;

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------
% NOTE: The aim in the following is to demonstrate how one might setup code
% to present a stimulus that changes on each frame. One would not for
% instance present a uniform screen of a fixed colour using this approach.
% The only reason I do this here to to make the code as simple as possible,
% and to avoid a screen which flickers a different colour every, say,
% 1/60th of a second. Virtually all the remianing demos show a stimulus
% which changes on each frame, so I want to show an approach which will
% generalise to the rest of the demos. Therefore, one would clearly not
% write a script in this form for an experiment; it is to demonstrate
% principles.
%
% Specifically,
%
% vbl + (waitframes - 0.5) * ifi
%
% is the same as
%
% vbl + 0.5 * ifi
%
% As here waitframes is set to 1 (i.e. (1 - 0.5) == 0.5)
%
% For discussion see PTB forum thread 20178 for discussion.

%------------
% EXAMPLE #1
%------------

% First we will demonstrate a poor way in which to get good timing of
% visually presented stimuli. We generally use this way of presenting in
% the demos in order to allow the demos to run on potentially defective
% hardware. In this way of presenting we leave much to chance as regards
% when our stimuli get to the screen, so it is not reccomended that you use
% this approach.
for frame = 1:numFrames

    % Color the screen grey
    Screen('FillRect', window, [0.5 0.5 0.5]);

    % Flip to the screen
    Screen('Flip', window);

end


%------------
% EXAMPLE #2
%------------

% Here we now specify a time at which PTB should be ready to draw to the
% screen by. In this example we use half a inter-frame interval. This
% specification allows us to get an accurate idea of whether PTB is making
% the stimulus timings we want.
vbl = Screen('Flip', window);
for frame = 1:numFrames
    
    vbl
    
    % Color the screen red
    Screen('FillRect', window, [0.5 0 0]);

    % Flip to the screen
    vbl = Screen('Flip', window, vbl + (waitframes - 0.5) * ifi);

end


%------------
% EXAMPLE #3
%------------

% Here we do exactly the same as the second example, but we additionally
% first set the PTB prority level to maximum. This means PTB will take
% processing priority over other system and applicaiton processes. I
% normally do this before and after stimulus presentation, however, on
% modern multi-core processors keeping Priority on is unlikely to overload
% system resources. Plus, on Linux this operation can take much much longer
% then on Windows and OSX (up to minutes in some use cases). So it is now
% suggested that you set Priority once at the start of a script after
% setting up your onscreen window.
% See PTB forum thread 20178 (and those linked to it) for discussion.
Priority(topPriorityLevel);
vbl = Screen('Flip', window);
for frame = 1:numFrames

    % Color the screen purple
    Screen('FillRect', window, [0.5 0 0.5]);

    % Flip to the screen
    vbl = Screen('Flip', window, vbl + (waitframes - 0.5) * ifi);

end
Priority(0);


%------------
% EXAMPLE #4
%------------

% Finally we do the same as the last example except now we additionally
% tell PTB that no more drawing commands will be given between coloring the
% screen and the flip command. This, can help acheive good timing when one
% is needing to do additional non-PTB processing between setting up drawing
% and flipping to the screen. Thus, you would only use this technique if
% you were doing this. So, if you are not, go with example #3
Priority(topPriorityLevel);
vbl = Screen('Flip', window);
for frame = 1:numFrames

    % Color the screen blue
    Screen('FillRect', window, [0 0 0.5]);

    % Tell PTB no more drawing commands will be issued until the next flip
    Screen('DrawingFinished', window);

    % One would do some additional stuff here to make the use of
    % "DrawingFinished" meaningful / useful

    % Flip to the screen
    vbl = Screen('Flip', window, vbl + (waitframes - 0.5) * ifi);

end
Priority(0);

% Clear the screen.
