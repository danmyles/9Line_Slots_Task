# Stimuli
<br/> 
It seemed to me that a neat place to start learning to code in Psych toolbox and MATLAB would be to start by drawing the stimuli
shapes to screen. In short this folder currently contains scripts to do each of the following:

  1. Draw a fixation cross
  2. Draw the circle, triangle, square, diamond, and pentagon shapes
  3. Draw each of these on screen in the appropriate position (still learning how to do this).
