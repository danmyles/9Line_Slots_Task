# Development
This folder contains parts of the project that I'm currently developing. Ultimately will be deleted when the directory stucuture is finalised after the project is complete.

We may want to start working with branches and do away with this folder structure approach entirely. I am currently practicing this Git workflow using the dan_development branch. Once I have made changes that I think should be contributed to the master branch I'll merge them back in. Once we get comfortable using this workflow I'll change the file structure to get rid of this development folder. Only thing to be aware of is that any scripts that include file paths may get messed around when we move things...
